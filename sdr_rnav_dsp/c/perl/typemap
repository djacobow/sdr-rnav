# Typemap file for the dplib wrapper to the dp library.
# Most of these typemaps entry do not provide true type 
# conversion at all. Instead, they merely allow the pointers
# to be captured in perl and relayed subsequently to other 
# functions. There is no knowledge of what those pointers 
# point to. When necessary, other functions, particularly
# those in dp_pl_shrelist.c and helpers.c provide accessors 
# that perl can use to access pointer contents.
