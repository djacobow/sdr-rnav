This folder contains a perl script that calls a function called 
remez which designs optimized FIR filters according to your specifications.
remez itself is an old piece of c code floating around the interwebs,
used in GnuRadio's filter designer as well as the signals package 
of GNU Octave. 

In fact, the function C code is copied verbatim from GNU Octave and
just wrapped a little to make it callable from Perl.

Older versions of this script called GNU Radio or Octave, requiring 
one or the other be installed, but now there should be no external
dependency at all.


The perl script takes a first argument which is the name of a file to
create that will contain the filer taps. The rest of the arguments are
source files to scan. Each file is scanned for comments that look like
YAML. If found, the YAML is interpreted as parameters for FIR filters
to be designed. 

The perl calls the python for each filter needed, and the results are
written to a .h and .c version of the output file.

The result is that the files with the comments can also reference 
arrays with the taps, and if the comment is changed and the project
recompiled, the new filter will automagically be there.
