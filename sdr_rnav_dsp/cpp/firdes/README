
This folder contains a perl script that calls a python script that 
in turn calls the remez() function provided by gnuradio. Therefore, 
for it to work, all three tools must be installed.

The perl script takes a first argument which is the name of a file to
create that will contain the filer taps. The rest of the arguments are
source files to scan. Each file is scanned for comments that look like
YAML. If found, the YAML is interpreted as parameters for FIR filters
to be designed. 

The perl calls the python for each filter needed, and the results are
written to a .h and .c version of the output file.

The result is that the files with the comments can also reference 
arrays with the taps, and if the comment is changed and the project
recompiled, the new filter will automagically be there.
